Brain Tumor MRI Classification

I created this project to classify MRI brain scans into two categories: Normal and Tumor. The aim is to provide a tool that could potentially assist in the early detection of brain tumors using machine learning techniques.



About the Dataset


The dataset used for this project contains labeled MRI brain scan images, split into two categories:

Normal: Images without tumors.
Tumor: Images with visible tumors.
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: MRI-Based Brain Tumor Images and was preprocessed to ensure consistency, including resizing and normalization.



Project Details


This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification. The network was trained on the labeled dataset and evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance.

Key Features:

Image Preprocessing: Resizing to 224x224 and normalization.
Binary Classification: A model built to distinguish between normal and tumor MRI images.
Performance Evaluation: Includes metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss visualization.


Technologies Used

Python
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data processing and visualization



Results


The model was evaluated using test data, and results were summarized using a confusion matrix and classification metrics.
